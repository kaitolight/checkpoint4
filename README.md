## About this project

The idea during this checkpoint was to make my portfolio. I thought about the database and the wireframes before starting the project but I didn't respect them 100% as things changed because of the short amount of time. The final product doesn't look like exactly what I had in mind and some features weren't developed due to the lack of time. However it'll surely be used a skeleton for muy real portfolio when I have time to develop it.
